    details: Own your infrastructure and billing. Run Silobase on Render, AWS, Azure, or locally, and stay in control of your stack from day one.

    details: Keep full ownership of your data from the start. Silobase is open source and MIT-licensed, so you’ll never face vendor lock-in.

  - title: Config-First Setup
    details: Define your backend in a simple `.env` file. Connect your database, set API keys, and deploy—no migrations, no boilerplate, no friction.

  - title: Secure by Default
